**Life Expectancy Analysis using Machine Learning**

**Project Overview**
Life expectancy is a crucial measure of public health and global development. Understanding its determinants is vital for policy-makers aiming to improve global health.
This project aims to classify life expectancy into categories (Low, Medium, High) based on socio-economic and health-related factors from the WHO dataset. By exploring various machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict life expectancy trends and identify the key determinants affecting public health globally.

**Algorithms**
1. Support vector machines (SVM)
2. TwinSVM
3. Decision Tree and Random Forest
4. Bagging and Boosting

**Dataset**
The dataset, sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO), contains features such as adult mortality, GDP, healthcare expenditure, and immunization rates. 

**Contributions**
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the project.
